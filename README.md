## About Growth

This game is similar to the popular game [Agario](https://www.agar.io), but it is made in 3D and with a few improvements.

## How to play

The player spawns as a sphere in the middle of a multi-staged arena, and can use `WSAD`, the arrow keys, or a controller with a joystick to move the player around. The player should eat the food that spawns on the platform, and all enemies that are smaller. Whenever two entities collide, the entity that is bigger eats the smaller enemy and grows, and the smaller enemy respawns.

Once you get big enough, you should be able to roll over the wall to find bigger enemies to eat.

Your score is displayed at the bottom of the screen, and reflects the radius of the player.

## Technical details

The game is built in Unity, and opens to the Unity Resolution Dialogue. It should work well for all resolutions and aspect ratios, even full screen.
